import BeaconQuerier from '../../../components/PageContent/BeaconQuerier.tsx';
import { ADDRESSES } from '../../../config.ts';

The Entropy Beacon is deployed on Terra's testnet, `pisco`, and its mainnet, `phoenix`. You can see the deployed addresses for the Beacon on the [Deployed Addresses](/beacon/docs/deployed-addresses) page.

# Deployment Notes
As part of the Entropic Labs community grant, the Entropy Beacon deployed on Terra's mainnet will soon subsidize fees using the community grant funds. This has not yet been implemented.

The Terra deployment is currently in permissioned mode. For those interested in hosting workers, please reach out to the Entropic team.
